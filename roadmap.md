# Zolden Protocol – Roadmap

Zolden is an early-stage infrastructure protocol focused on AI-powered tokenization of real-world assets with DePIN alignment. The roadmap reflects key development milestones in research, infrastructure, and protocol design.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations
- Finalize core architecture for Z-Core (AI asset onboarding layer)
- Design and develop asset tokenization smart contracts
- Research integration pathways for decentralized data sources and DePIN actors

## Phase 2 — MVP & Internal Validation
- Deploy internal MVP with simulated asset flows
- Begin validation of AI-based risk models and asset scoring
- Implement sensor-based data ingestion modules (DePIN-compatible)

## Phase 3 — Protocol Expansion
- Expand support to broader RWA categories (e.g. infrastructure, machinery)
- Add modular support for oracle networks and geolocation-based assets
- Design cross-chain compatibility and on-chain/off-chain sync

## Phase 4 — Governance & Incentives
- Introduce AI-assisted governance logic (proposal scoring and filtering)
- Design tokenomics and incentive alignment (no public token yet)
- Begin community feedback cycles via private contributor program
