# Zolden Protocol

Zolden is building the foundational infrastructure for AI-powered tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) with a strong focus on DePIN alignment. Designed as an early-stage protocol, Zolden bridges physical assets and decentralized intelligence in a scalable and composable way.

## Vision

Enable a future where tokenized real-world assets are governed, distributed and operated by AI-powered networks and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).

## Highlights

- AI-assisted onboarding and validation of real-world assets
- Token lifecycle logic embedded in smart contracts
- DePIN-aligned architecture: storage, compute, sensors
- Cross-chain interoperability planned from day one
- Early-stage, focused on long-term protocol value

## Architecture (Early Design)

- Z-Core: AI logic layer powering validation, valuation, and lifecycle management
- Asset Layer: Tokenization contracts for on-chain representation of physical assets
- DePIN Integration: Modular hooks for data oracles, off-chain infra, geolocation, IoT
- Governance Layer: To be introduced post-token launch, Q4 2025+

## Status

- Internal research completed (AI + DePIN intersections)
- MVP smart contracts under internal audit
- No token yet. Community and development updates will be posted via official channels only.
