# Zolden – Security and Audit Policy

Security is foundational to Zolden’s development process. All core components undergo internal code review and threat modeling before deployment to any public environment.

### Current Status
- Internal MVPs are audited by in-house reviewers
- All contracts remain in private repos until external audit planning
- We follow secure software development practices (threat modeling, static analysis, internal bug bounties)

### Future Plans
- External audit for tokenization layer prior to mainnet  
- Ongoing audit cycles planned for each major module  
- Zolden will publish audit reports publicly when available

Please report any suspected vulnerabilities to:  
security@zolden.foundation
