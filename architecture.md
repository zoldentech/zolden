# Zolden Protocol â€“ Architecture Overview

Zolden is structured around modular components that bridge real-world assets with on-chain intelligence. The architecture is designed to be adaptive, scalable, and aligned with decentralized infrastructure layers (DePIN).

### Core Components

Z-Core (AI Logic Engine):  
- Processes off-chain data from trusted and decentralized sources  
- Applies scoring, validation, and classification algorithms  
- Interfaces with the asset layer to approve or reject tokenization

Asset Layer (Tokenization Engine):  
- Smart contracts representing RWA on-chain  
- Includes asset lifecycle management and embedded metadata standards  
- Built-in role logic for asset issuers, operators, and validators

DePIN Integration Layer:  
- Connects with decentralized sensors, storage and compute nodes  
- Enables real-time feedback on asset conditions, location, and usage  
- Allows dynamic asset state updates on-chain

Governance Layer (Planned):  
- AI-assisted proposal evaluation and prioritization  
- Modular voting mechanisms for contributors and stakeholders  
- Designed for decentralization post-protocol maturity
