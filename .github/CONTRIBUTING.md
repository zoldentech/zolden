# Contributing to Zolden

Thank you for your interest in contributing. At this stage, we are not accepting public pull requests.

We plan to open specific modules for public collaboration once core infrastructure reaches internal maturity.

Until then, you may:
- Follow progress via GitHub and X (Twitter): @zoldentech
- Share technical suggestions via Issues (when enabled)
- Watch the repository for updates

Please respect the development process. Zolden is not an open-source playground â€” it's an infrastructure protocol under continuous validation.
